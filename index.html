			<h1>About K-GE</h1>
			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>K-Pop Group Evolution is a GVSU cultural club whose mission is to teach Korean culture through K-Pop. Our aim is to accomplish this through performance of K-Pop dance covers as well as weekly cultural presentations and other activities in partnership with GVSU cultural organizations and with the local non-profit Korean Connection of West Michigan.</p>
			<h2>Practice Schedule Fall 2019</h2>
				<p>K-GE practices three times a week to prepare for various performances. To be an active member of K-GE, you must make 2 out of 3 practices each week as defined in our constitution (although we highly encourage you to make all 3 if possible). Listed below are our practice times and locations.</p>
				<ul class="indentedbulletlist">
					<li>Time slot 1 - TBA</li>
					<li>Time slot 2 - TBA</li>
					<li>Time slot 3 - TBA</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Our Origins</h2>
				<p>K-GE was founded in 2013 by GVSU students. Since then, K-GE has evolved with the election of new E-Board members, expanding our outreach to new events each year within both the GVSU and the Grand Rapids communities. We have also worked closely with Korean Connection of Western Michigan to promote Korean culture and language lessons, which many K-GE members have actively participated in.</p>
				<p>K-GE E-Board members have also created new in-club performance opportunities, such as Spotlight Day (new as of 2018-2019 academic year) to further showcase individual members.</p>
				<p>K-GE has evolved from its origins and will continue to change and grow to better reflect the aspirations of its members in promoting education on Korean culture and imitating said culture through dance.</p>
